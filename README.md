## Project Overview
The News Summarizer and Translator project aims to provide concise and accurate summaries of news articles, translating them into various regional languages to enhance accessibility and understanding for a broader audience. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automate the summarization and translation processes.

## Features
- Extract full text from news articles.
- Generate concise summaries of news articles.
- Translate summaries into multiple regional languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, and Tamil.
- User-friendly interface for inputting URLs and selecting summary preferences.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Requests**: For fetching web content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML content.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Googletrans**: For translating text into different languages.
